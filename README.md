# WPower

A web application for turning home appliances on or off, scheduling lights to come on and viewing data about power usage.

- Turn appliances on/off via a panel
- Schedule appliances to come on at a certain hour of the day
- View 3 different Graphs for power usage

- Add/delete user logins

This project was created for use on a Raspberry Pi and made use of the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins and Linux's CRONTAB.


This was created by Jake Nelson for my A2 Edexcel Computing Coursework.
